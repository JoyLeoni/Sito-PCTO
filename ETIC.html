              The Work-Based Learning experience at ETIC S.R.L. proved to be extremely educational and insightful. I had the opportunity to observe the company’s operations up close, gaining a clearer understanding of how a modern business is structured and how internal workflows are managed.
            </p>
            <p class="slide-text">
              From the very beginning, I was welcomed as part of the team, and I was encouraged to ask questions and participate actively. This helped me become more aware of my potential and more confident in a professional environment.

              I was assigned to a software development team working on 3D environment visualization. Within this team, I contributed to creating interactive digital experiences using industry-standard tools such as Unity and Blender.
            </p>
            <p class="slide-text">
              This technical experience allowed me to refine my skills in modeling, rendering, and user interaction, while also learning to collaborate in an agile and goal-oriented team. I was exposed to version control systems, task boards, and collaborative coding sessions, which are vital in real-world software projects.

              Alongside the technical work, I also assisted with logistics operations. I helped organize and carry out local deliveries, which gave me hands-on experience with time management, responsibility, and direct customer interaction.
            </p>
            <p class="slide-text">
              This mix of technical and operational tasks helped me understand how different departments within a company must coordinate and communicate effectively for everything to function smoothly.

              At the end of my internship, the company offered me a temporary position for the summer. I gladly accepted and spent an additional month working full-time, further integrating into the team and taking on more advanced tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="slide-text">
              During this period, I contributed to an actual project for a client, taking responsibility for specific features, fixing bugs, and improving the user experience. This gave me a deeper sense of purpose and helped solidify my interest in the IT field as a future career path.
