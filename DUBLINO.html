          We attended lessons at CES Coppinger Row.<br>
          This allowed us to improve our language skills and immerse ourselves in Irish culture.<br>
          In addition to the lessons, we had the opportunity to interact with our "host parents" in their family homes.<br>
          The interactive activities proposed by the teachers made learning more engaging and stimulating.

          We travelled around Ireland to better understand the local lifestyle<br>
          and its territory.<br>
          Each stage of the journey offered us breathtaking landscapes, from the Atlantic coast to the green hills of the countryside.<br>
          We visited historical sites, castles, and small villages, directly experiencing local traditions and the warm Irish hospitality.
